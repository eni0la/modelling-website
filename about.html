                Eniola is a signed BETH model, Entrepreneur and Frontend(UI Developer) Developer.She works mainly on beauty, portrait works, fashion editorials and commercial print jobs. Raised in Lagos, she fell in love with modelling after competing at a school pageant that she won a category, and has been doing it professionally ever since. She has worked with different photographers and makeup artists, has done campaigns and worked with companies including CasualBecky and others. Eniola aims to keep following her heart and trust where fate leads her with the goals of expanding her modeling career and continuing to explore the fashion world. <br> <br>
          Outside of modelling, Eniola's passion for technology led her to take her first coding class in 2019. Inspired by codeâ€™s creativity and endless possibility, Eniola designed and launched her website in 2020 to empower girls to learn how to code and become leaders in tech. Now in its second year, she is working towards an organization that hosts summer coding camps where girls aged 13 to 18 explore concepts in front-end software engineering. <br> <br>
