 I am Joan Smith and for last 6 years I worked as a photo model. I have a huge passion for acting and I love being in front of the camera. I mainly shoot fashion, swimwear and lingerie but I also enjoy creative projects like bodypaint or dress up. I am currently modeling for XYZ  Model Agency and individual photographers. My photos were published in ABC and  CBA magazines and I was part of LALALA campaign. I am available for photo shoots in California, but available to travel to other destinations in US.
                  I am tall (5’11’), long hair natural brunette with tanned skin, which makes me a good model for swimwear and lingerie photos. I enjoy working with photographers and agencies that have a creative approach. I bring my energy and passion for modeling to every project I work on.​
